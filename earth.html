            <h1>EARTH TO EARTH TRANSPORTATION</h1>
            <p>With Starship and Super Heavy, most of what people consider to be long distance trips would be completed in less than half an hour. In addition to vastly increased speed, one great benefit about traveling in space, outside of Earthâ€™s atmosphere, is the lack of friction as well as turbulence and weather.</p>
            <p>Consider how much time we currently spend traveling from one place to another. Now imagine most journeys taking less than 30 minutes, with access to anywhere in the world in an hour or less.</p>
