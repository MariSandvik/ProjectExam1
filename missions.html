            <h1>PRIVATE LUNAR MISSION</h1>
            <p>On September 17, 2018, SpaceX announced fashion innovator and globally recognized art curator Yusaku Maezawa will be the companyâ€™s first private passenger to fly around the Moon in 2023. </p>
            <p>To date, only 24 people have visited the Moon, with the last of them flying in 1972. This first private lunar passenger flight, featuring a fly-by of the Moon as part of a weeklong mission, will help fund development of SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy (formerly known as BFR), an important step in enabling access for everyday people who dream of flying to space.</p>

            <h1>MISSIONS TO MARS</h1>
            <p>Our aspirational goal is to send our first cargo mission to Mars in 2022. The objectives for the first mission will be to confirm water resources, identify hazards, and put in place initial power, mining, and life support infrastructure.</p>
            <p>A second mission, with both cargo and crew, is targeted for 2024, with primary objectives of building a propellant depot and preparing for future crew flights. The ships from these initial missions will also serve as the beginnings of the first Mars base, from which we can build a thriving city and eventually a self-sustaining civilization on Mars.</p>

            <h1>SPACE STATION MISSIONS</h1>
            <p>Building Moon bases and Mars cities will require affordable delivery of significant quantities of cargo and people. The fully reusable Starship system uses in-space propellant transfer to enable the delivery of over 100t of useful mass to the surface of the Moon or Mars. This system is designed to ultimately carry as many as 100 people on long-duration, interplanetary flights.</p>
